Rebuild my [billing] page and its supporting pages/forms/components to match the Fuel Tracker design pattern. I dont really want you to change anything with the current settings layout though I like how its setup already i just need your help getting everything functional like dark mode and just making sure theres no console logs or any problems with mobile resposiveness and also with the pricing i want to make sure it matches up with stripe you can also use the stripe mcp as need to make any changes.

### Reference Files:

- Design spec: `docs/FUEL_TRACKER_DESIGN_SPEC.md`
- Reference component: `src/components/FuelTrackerPage.js`
- Current page: `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/[PAGE_ROUTE]/page.js`
- Current components: `src/components/[PAGE_FOLDER]/`

### Design Patterns to Apply:

1. **Header**: Blue gradient (`from-blue-600 to-blue-500 dark:from-blue-700 dark:to-blue-600`) with
   title, subtitle, and action buttons
2. **Layout**: 4-column grid (1 sidebar + 3 main content)
3. **Stat Cards**: Match `FuelStats.js` - icon RIGHT side, border-left accent, text-2xl value
4. **Filter Bar**: Search input + dropdowns (category, date range, sort)
5. **Sidebar Widgets**: Top items list + categories filter

### Required Utilities:

- Error handling: `import { getUserFriendlyError } from '@/lib/utils/errorMessages'`
- Pagination: `import { usePagination } from '@/hooks/usePagination'` (10 items per page)
- Feedback: `import { OperationMessage, EmptyState } from '@/components/ui/OperationMessage'`

### Features to Include:

- Full dark mode support (all `dark:` variants)
- Real-time Supabase subscriptions
- localStorage form persistence
- Mobile responsive (card view on mobile, table on desktop)
- CSV export functionality
- Loading skeletons

### After Building:

1. Use BrowserMCP to compare with Fuel Tracker page visually
2. Use shadcn MCP to find better UI components if needed
3. Run Semgrep security scan on new code
4. Remove any console.log statements
5. Verify no console errors in browser
